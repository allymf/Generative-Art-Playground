 Hi, I'm **Alysson**. That's a picture of myself on the right. 👉🏼
 
 I'm a research intern at **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE**, and undergraduate of **Digital Media and Systems** at **Universidade Federal do Ceará**.
 
 ### Prepared for storytime?
 
 Many people tend to think that “*Art is for artist*”. I was very frustrated with this concept, being, among other things, a coder which is not seen as a potential artist by common sense.🙇🏻‍♂️
 
 But art comes in different forms, by people with various backgrounds, and is created with such diverse tools. Code can be a tool for creating beautiful art.🎨🖌
 
 During a very dark period of my life, I really felt the need to express my feelings. I spent a lot of time looking for a venue to do so artistically. But I couldn't find a media that fit my abilities, which are concentrated on digital media, mainly code. I felt the urge to use them in a more creative way.🤔
 
 Last year, I attend a subject at my university and there I discovered the Generative Art and it blew my mind. 🤯🤩
 
 I finally found a way and throughout this playground I would like to show you the magic of it.

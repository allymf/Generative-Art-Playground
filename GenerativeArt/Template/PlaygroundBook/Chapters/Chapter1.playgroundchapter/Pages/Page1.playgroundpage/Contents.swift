 Many people tend to think that ‚ÄúArt is for artist‚Äù. I was very frustrated with this concept, being, among other things, a coder which is not seen as a potential artist by common sense.
 
 Art comes in different forms, by people with various backgrounds, and is created with such diverse tools. Code can be a tool for creating beautiful art
 
 During a very dark period of my life, I really felt the need to express my feeling. I spent a lot of time looking for a venue to express my feelings through art. I wasn‚Äôt so good with the guitar to ‚Äúsolo‚Äù my feeling out, nor was I too able to draw awesome drawings. My abilities were almost always focused on digital media. e.g. Designing and programing. But my work was always very pragmatic, and I felt the urge to use them in a more creative way.
 
 Last year, I attend a subject at my university and there I discovered the Generative Art.
 
 And it blew my mind. ü§Øü§©
 
 Finally was I able to use my skills in a more artistic way.
 
 Throughout this playground I would like to show you the magic of generative art

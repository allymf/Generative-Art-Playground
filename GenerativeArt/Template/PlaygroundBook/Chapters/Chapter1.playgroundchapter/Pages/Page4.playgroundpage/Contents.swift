 I hope that this experience gave you some insights on generative art . I hope I could transmit you a little bit of the magic I see in it.🧙🏼‍♂️
 
 There are great tools, for you to unleash your potential in this area, e.g. Processing and Isadora. But now it's up to you.😉
 
 - Note:
 This playgroundbook cover, the filtered picture of myself, and the ASCII art lettering were all made using processes of generative art.
 
 - Note:
 The cover and the filtered image were solely created by me, using Processing.💪🏼

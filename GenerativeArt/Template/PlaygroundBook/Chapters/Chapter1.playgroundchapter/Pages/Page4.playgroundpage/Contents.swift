 I hope that this experience gave you some insights on generative art . I hope I could transmit you a little bit of the magic I see in it.
 
 There are great tools, for you to unleash your potential in this area, e.g. Processing and Isadora. But now it's up to you.
 
 All the assets used in this playground were made using generative art
